Provide context for readers who are not familiar with the topic.\nInstructions (delete later): # (suggested: 1 page)\nFor visitors and people who are new to New York, safety often comes to mind. We’d like to identify any trends to see which areas/boroughs are actually dangerous. We are especially curious about this since we are also new to the city.\nA few questions that come to mind are:\n\nWhat areas/boroughs are dangerous?\nWhat areas are safe?\nWhat types of crimes occurred?\nAre there seasonal patterns or trends over time when crimes occurred?\nAre there patterns in the premises these crimes occurred in?\nHow effective are authorities in responding and stopping these crimes?\nWhat groups are frequently targeted?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nInstructions (delete later): # Identify one or more data sources (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe how the data are collected and by whom. Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, dimensions, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Explain how you plan to import the data. Carefully document your sources with links to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.)\nInstructions (delete later): #(suggested: 1 page)\nThis dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for all complete quarters so far this year (2023). This data is manually extracted and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning.\nEach record represents a criminal complaint in NYC and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to victim and suspect demographics is also included.\nThe data is provided by NYPD and is updated quarterly. It was made public in November 2018.\nWe can download the data from the NYPD and import into R as a csv file. It can be downloaded from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data\nThere are 415310 rows and 36 columns. Important columns include:\nLocation:\n\nPrecinct where incident occurred\nBorough where incident occurred\nPatrol borough in which incident occurred\nPremise (grocery store, residence, street, etc)\nLocation at premise (inside premises, front of, rear of, etc)\nTransit station name\nParks: NYC park, greenspace, playground, if applicable\nNYCHA housing development level\nLatitude/Longitude\n\nCrime details:\n\nDate of incident\nTime of incident\nLevel of offense (felony, misdemeanor, violation)\nCrime success (indicates if crime was successful or failed)\nJurisdiction responsible for incident (ex: police, transit police, long island rail road, etc)\n\nIndividuals’ info:\n\nSuspect’s Age group\nSuspect’s race\nSuspect’s sex\nVictim’s age group\nVictim’s race\nVictim’s sex\n\nThere are also end date and end time columns, which are populated if initial date and time are not known. We will have to handle the rows where the exact timing of the crime is unknown.\n#Explain in detail how your data will enable you to answer your research questions from the introduction.\n#(suggested: 1 page)\nWe have details on the location, date, time, type of crime, premise, jurisdiction responsible, and crime success. We can look at the frequency of different crime levels across locations, premises, dates, and times. We can also compare different crime levels across victim age, race, and sex. We can also plot the frequency of successful crimes to failed ones across jurisdictions to analyze how often crimes are successful, and which jurisdiction fails or succeeds to stop them."
