For visitors and people who are new to New York, safety often comes to mind. We'd like to identify any trends to see which areas/boroughs are actually dangerous. We are especially curious about this since we are also new to the city.

A few questions that come to mind are:

- What areas/boroughs are dangerous?

- What areas are safe?

- What types of crimes occurred?

- Are there seasonal patterns or trends over time when crimes occurred?

- Are there patterns in the premises these crimes occurred in?

- How effective are authorities in responding and stopping these crimes?

- What groups are frequently targeted?
