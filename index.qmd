# Introduction


For visitors and people who are new to New York City, safety often comes to mind. We'd like to identify any trends to see which areas/boroughs are actually dangerous. We are especially curious about this since we are also new to the city.

A few questions that come to mind are:

- What areas/boroughs are dangerous (tend to have more crime than other areas)?

- What areas are safe (tend to have less crime than other areas)?

- What types of crimes occurred?

- Are there seasonal patterns or trends over time when crimes occurred?

- Are there patterns in the premises these crimes occurred in?

- What groups are frequently targeted?
